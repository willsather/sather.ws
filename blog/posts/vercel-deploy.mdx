## Overview

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) _(formerly known as Zeit prior to 2020)_ is designed for simple deployments of Next.js applications (or other frontend applications).

For a certain project, we had started deploying to Vercel to gain use from its simple setup and user experience, 
but our team also wanted to use GitHub Actions to build and run our tests.  Following this
[guide](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-github-actions-with-vercel) on Vercel, we 
figured it would be easy to disconnect Vercel's GitHub connection
and strictly use the CLI to deploy through Actions.  After some time of fighting, we 
were able to configure it how we wanted, but the fidgeting took longer than I thought it would, so I figured I'd share...

## Codebase

This post assumes you already have an initialized Next.js application; this specific example will have the project
at the root of the repository (and not within `/app`).  The example I used also has tests that can be run with `npm test`.
To see this repository, it's on GitHub [here](https://github.com/satherw/nextjs-github-actions-vercel).

## Configure workflow

First, here is the GitHub action workflow that we used

<Note>This configuration includes jobs for building, testing, and deploying the application</Note>


```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build --if-present

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:ci

  deploy:
    needs: [build, test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest
      - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: vercel --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

The primary code of importance here is the final `deploy` job, which comes almost directly off the guide
Vercel wrote.  If you need more help, GitHub Actions [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is quite thorough.

These steps under the `deploy` job are pretty straightforward, it
1. checks out the repository
2. pulls the Vercel environment info
3. builds the Next.js application _(using the aforementioned env info)_
4. deploys the built application to vercel production environment

The only thing worth noting here is that the `--prebuilt` parameter is only needed when the `vercel build` command is being used prior to the deploy.
It is possible to build the application during the `vercel deploy` in which the parameter would not be needed.  We found it easier to read
and debug in our example if we had them as two different steps.

## Secrets

First, you must find all three tokens/secrets/IDs Vercel requires to authenticate and deploy.

1. `VERCEL_TOKEN`
    * On Vercel, go to User Profile > Settings > Tokens (Create new token)
2. `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
    * On Vercel, go to Project > Settings > Overview > Project ID
3. `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
      * Install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) on machine
      * `vercel login` to authenticate machine with Vercel
      * At the root of your project, run `vercel link` which will link local directory to Vercel
      * `.vercel/project.json` will contain both your **projectId** and **orgId**

Secondly, you need to configure the GitHub secrets that the pipeline uses by going to
Repository > Settings > Secrets > Actions and creating new repository secrets

## Vercel Configuration

One problem we faced was that we were unable to get the pipeline to retrieve the correct buildCommand and installCommand
(just retrieving `null`) when our workflow ran.

```json
{
  "projectId": "***",
  "orgId": "***",
  "settings": {
    "createdAt": "***",
    "framework": null,
    "devCommand": null,
    "installCommand": null,
    "buildCommand": null,
    "outputDirectory": null,
    "rootDirectory": null,
    "directoryListing": false,
    "nodeVersion": "18.x"
  }
}
```

Vercel doesn't offer an obvious warning that your application isn't being deployed nor even being built,
so it would keep deploying to a `404` without any errors or warnings.

One way of verifying that these commands are configured correctly is to `pull` the Vercel "configuration" using the CLI and by deploying
locally from the command line.

```bash
vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

Another way of verifying the configuration (on the GitHub Action too) is to include the following yaml lines
in your workflow.  Most of our problems arose from missing Vercel Next.js commands when pulling from our project and printing out
the returned values made it easier to debug.

```yaml
- name: Print out Vercel config
  run: pwd && ls -la && cat .vercel/.env.production.local && cat .vercel/project.json
```

If this is a problem, inside the Vercel project settings, you can override the **Build & Development Settings**
with the following:

<Image alt="Vercel Build & Development Settings" src="/assets/blog/images/vercel-deploy/vercelBuildSettings.png" width={1846} height={1090}/>

while leaving the **Output Directory** and **Development Command** on default.

This should then return the following configuration allowing you to deploy to Vercel using the GitHub Action (or locally)

```json
{
  "projectId": "***",
  "orgId": "***",
  "settings": {
    "createdAt": "***",
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "devCommand": null,
    "installCommand": "npm install",
    "buildCommand": "next build",
    "outputDirectory": null,
    "rootDirectory": null,
    "directoryListing": false,
    "nodeVersion": "18.x"
  }
}
```

## Deployed   ðŸŽ‰

Now, whenever a commit is made on the `main` branch, GitHub actions will build, test, and deploy to Vercel.  This is useful for building more complicated
pipelines that can do anything you want as well as abstracting the deployment details away from Vercel for future
(easily swappable with other products like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)).
