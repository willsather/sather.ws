summary: "Adding custom props to a styled Material UI component"

## Overview

I was recently trying to customize a [Material UI Checkbox](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-checkbox/) in order to modify
the styles when in an `error` state. I noticed that Material UI had predetermined classes for things liked `&.Mui-Checked`
and so on, but Material UI didn't have an error state. In my case, I had a checkbox which was required to be checked before moving
on (for consent capture). So, here is how I did it:

### Styled Component

To pass in a prop to `styled`, you just can add any custom prop right next to the `theme` prop as seen below. However,
once you compile and run your application, you'll notice a warning:

<Warning>
  React does not recognize the "error" prop on a DOM element. If you
  intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as
  lowercase error instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent
  component, remove it from the DOM element.
</Warning>

This is because MUI doesn't recognize the prop even though you pass it in (at this point it works, but you just have a warning.
The nice thing is that MUI `styled` provides an optional parameter for options, which, in this case, the `shouldForwardProp` option.
This option tells Material UI to forward the `error` prop to the styled component, which then gets rid of the error.

```jsx
"use client";

import { styled } from "@mui/material/styles";
import Checkbox from "@mui/material/Checkbox";

const CustomCheckbox = styled(Checkbox, {
  shouldForwardProp: (prop) => prop !== "error",
})(({ theme, error = false }) => ({
  color: error
    ? theme.palette.colorTheme.error
    : theme.palette.colorTheme.primary,
  "&.Mui-checked": {
    color: theme.palette.colorTheme.primary,
  },
  ariaRoleDescription: "checkbox",
}));

export default CustomCheckbox;
```

### Usage

So, now that the custom checkbox is configured, you can utilize it like this:

```jsx
<NormalCheckbox
  checked={isChecked}
  error={showError}
  onClick={({ target }) => onCheckChanged(target.checked)}
/>
```

And that's it, that's all you need to add custom props to a styled component using Material UI. This can be extended to
meet all sorts of use cases like `error` in my case, but also customizing other behavior. Cheers!
