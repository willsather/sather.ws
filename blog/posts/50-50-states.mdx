## The Goal

Ever since I was quite little, it always seemed like there was some lore around traveling to every single state in America.
Whether it was from parents, friends, or just the sheer sense of exploration, there was always a goal - a bucket list item.
I was never quite sure how I'd make it happen or when I'd be able to accomplish a feat so large, but I wanted to try. As I got
older, and more independent, I realized I wasn't too far off. Luckily, with family and work in various parts of the country, I was
enabled to get out a little bit more than expected. However, as I approached state 35, I set the goal of doing all 50 states before 25
years old. For no good reason really, just that as a math geek, it's perfectly divisible - two states a year.
