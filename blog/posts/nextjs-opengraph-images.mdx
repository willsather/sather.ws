## Overview

Recently, I was looking to design my own Open Graph images for this very blog, and in doing so, I found out that Next.js
supports dynamically generating images for SEO purposes. I figured this would be way faster than manually designing one each time,
plus helps avoid needing to manually add and store all these images in a `/public` folder.

For a quick background, Open Graph images are the image 'preview' when you see a link. These commonly are shown on social media,
text messages, and other previews. You can read more about the protocol at [The Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/). I also
have used [Opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) to preview websites and also see some examples. For context, this is what a blog post on this
site looks like at the time of writing it (using the code below).

<Image
  alt="Open Graph Preview"
  src="/assets/blog/images/nextjs-open-graph-images/preview.png"
  width={2214}
  height={1596}
/>

### Generating the image

Using the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image),
I was able to customize it a little bit and come up with a generic/default Open Graph image for the entire site,
located at the root of the App Router.

```tsx fileName="/app/opengraph-image.tsx"
import { ImageResponse } from "next/server";
import Logo from "@/src/components/shared/logo";

export const size = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
};

export const alt = "Will Sather";
export const contentType = "image/png";

export default async function DefaultOpengraphImage() {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div tw="flex h-full w-full flex-col items-center justify-center bg-black">
        <div tw="flex flex-none items-center justify-center h-[160px] w-[160px]">
          <Logo width="64" height="58" fill="white" />
        </div>
        <div tw="flex items-center justify-center mt-12 mx-16">
          <h1 tw="text-7xl text-center font-bold text-white font-sans font-bold">Will Sather</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
    size
  );
}
```

However, I wanted to take it one step further and actually create dynamic pages for each blog post page, so that the generated
image would include the title and date included in the `MDX` [FrontMatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter) data.
So, nested in the `/blog/posts/opengraph-image.tsx` there is a second OpenGraph Image component that Next.js uses to
generate the Open Graph image using the `params?.slug` to load the blog post and the frontmatter data to generate the correct image.

```tsx fileName="/app/blog/posts/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx"
import { ImageResponse } from "next/server";
import { loadMdxFromSlug } from "@/lib/blog/utils";
import { BlogFrontMatter } from "@/src/types/blogFrontMatter";
import Logo from "@/src/components/shared/logo";

export const size = {
  width: 1200,
  height: 630,
};

export const alt = "Blog | Will Sather";
export const contentType = "image/png";

export default async function OpengraphImage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const { data } = await loadMdxFromSlug(params?.slug);
  const frontMatter = data as BlogFrontMatter;

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div tw="flex h-full w-full flex-col items-center justify-center bg-black">
        <div tw="flex flex-none items-center justify-center h-[160px] w-[160px]">
          <Logo width="64" height="58" fill="white" />
        </div>
        <div tw="flex items-center justify-center mt-12 mx-16">
          <h1 tw="text-7xl text-center font-bold text-white font-sans font-bold">{frontMatter.title}</h1>
        </div>

        <div tw="flex items-center justify-center mx-16">
          <h2 tw="text-3xl text-center font-bold text-white font-sans font-bold">
            {frontMatter.date.toLocaleDateString()}
          </h2>
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
    size
  );
}
```
