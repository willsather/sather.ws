## Background
When I studied at University of Minnesota, one of the first computer science classes I took was Introduction to Computer Science -
one of the basic, entry level Python classes.  Also during school, I was taking some math classes and decided to go for a mathematics
minor just because I enjoyed the classes.

One of the most memorable projects I worked on that first semester was a python script that uses the visualization tool Turtle
to simulate throwing darts at a 1-foot by 1-foot square board that contains 1-foot diameter circle inside of it.
It would look something like this:

[//]: # (<Image alt="Concept" src="/assets/blog/images/estimating-pi/concept.png" width={2214} height={1596}/>)

The idea was that if you throw enough darts at the board (all of which land in the 1x1 square), the number of darts in the circle
divided by the total darts that hit the board would equal one quarter of Pi.  If you throw 4 darts and 3 of which land in the circle, this
calculation would look like `(3 darts hit / 4 darts thrown) * 4 = 3`, which is not very far off from the number Pi we all love and know, but
definitely needs to be closer to the irrational number.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulations are basically a type of computational algorithm that uses repeated random sampling to calculate or generate
some relevant statistic or mathematical answer.  This method of estimating Pi is a very basic example of the Monte Carlo algorithm.

The script looks something like this:

```python fileName="estimate.py"
import turtle
import random


def estimate_pi(iterations):
    turtle.penup()
    turtle.speed(0)

    darts_in = 0
    darts_total = 0

    for iteration in range(iterations):
        y_coordinate = random.uniform(-1, 1)
        x_coordinate = random.uniform(-1, 1)

        if (((x_coordinate ** 2) + (y_coordinate ** 2)) ** 0.5) <= 1:
            color = "green"
            darts_in = darts_in + 1
            darts_total = darts_total + 1

        else:
            color = "red"
            darts_total = darts_total + 1

        turtle.setpos(x_coordinate * 150, y_coordinate * 150)
        turtle.dot(5, color)

    pi_approx = 4 * (darts_in / darts_total)

    print("Pi is approximately: {0:.4f}".format(pi_approx))

    turtle.done()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    estimate_pi(250)
```


## Results  ðŸŽ‰
I personally love the way the math can be visualized so easy with such a simple Python script.  As always, the code can
be found on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/willsather/pi-approximation) - feel free to clone and run locally,
it's quite fun to mess around with.
