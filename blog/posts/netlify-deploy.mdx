summary: "How to manually build and deploy a Next.js App Router application to Netlify using a GitHub Action pipeline."
---

## Overview

Recently, I migrated my website from Angular to Next.js and React, with attempts to utilize Next.js new App Router architecture.
In doing so, I wanted to replace my Netlify Git connector with GitHub Actions, as I had intentions of building, testing, and linting the
codebase before a successful deployment. However, I ran into some nuances with the App Router, Netlify, and Next.js that I wanted to document here.

You can view the deployed application at [sather.ws](https://sather.ws) and the GitHub repository at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/willsather/website).

## Configure workflow

First thing I did was to create the GitHub action workflow:

<Info>
  This configuration includes jobs for building, testing, and deploying the
  application
</Info>

```yml
name: dev
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install --silent --immutable

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Test
        run: npm run test:ci

      - name: Integration Test
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          config: baseUrl=http://localhost:3000
          quiet: false
          browser: chrome
          headless: true
          record: false
          start: npm start
          wait-on: http://localhost:3000
          wait-on-timeout: 180

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Install Netlify
        run: npm install -g netlify-cli @netlify/plugin-nextjs@appdir

      - name: Build Artifact
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        run: netlify deploy --site ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_DEV_SITE_ID }} /
          --auth ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }} /
          --dir=.next --build --prod /
          --message "Deploy - GitHub Actions"
```

The primary code of importance here is the final `deploy` job, which directly utilizes installing and deploying via Netlify CLI.
There is more documentation for the `yaml` at [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

These steps under the `deploy` job are pretty straightforward, it

1. checks out the repository
2. installs dependencies and builds artifact
3. installs Netlify CLI
4. deploys to specified environment

The only thing worth noting here is that the `--dir=.next` parameter specifying the build output file location. Secondly,
according to Netlify's documentation, App Router Next.js Applications MUST use the `--build` parameter. Finally, the rest of
the parameters just cover Netlify Authentication and setting a message to make it all a little cleaner in the Netlify platform.

Lastly, there is one critical piece to this puzzle, which is the `npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs@appdir` which not only
adds support for Next.js applications, but specifically the App Router.

This package will automatically detect the App Router application and deploy a site for the frontend and Netlify functions
for the API routes and Image optimizations.

## Secrets

First, you need to have a `Netlify Auth Token` and `Netlify Site ID`, both of which can be found on Netlify's platform.

Once you have those two pieces of information, you need to configure the GitHub Actions secrets to include them as named above.

## Netlify Configuration

You can also a Netlify configuration to specify configuration in `netlify.toml` file, like shown here:

```toml fileName="netlify.toml"
[build]
  base = "."
  publish = ".next"
  command = "npm run build"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs@appdir"
```

## Deployed ðŸŽ‰

Now, whenever a commit is made on the `main` branch, GitHub actions will build, test, and deploy to Netlify (in this case, the dev site).
This is useful for building more complicated pipelines that can do anything you want as well as abstracting the deployment details away
from the Netlify Git connector hook.
