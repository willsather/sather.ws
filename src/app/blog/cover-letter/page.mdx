# Cover Letter (2025)

## Who

My name is Will Sather, and I’m a Minnesota native software engineer, receiving my computer science degree at U of MN in 2022. Following graduation, I moved out to Boston to work at VMware Tanzu Labs (previously Pivotal Labs).

Over the last four years of my software engineering career, I have relevant full stack backend and frontend experience building net-new/startup software to modernizing 30+ year old legacy code. My role at VMware was unique in the sense that I worked for customers building software in many different industries, primarily the financial and healthcare sectors. More details about technologies, as well as my resume, can be found at [sather.ws/work](https://www.sather.ws/work).

## What

I’m beginning to explore a career move in software, focusing on two key areas of interest. The first is a software engineering role on a product or R&D team, where I can contribute and build, possibly in a tech lead / small team lead role. The second option would be a technical customer/sales engineering role, using my customer facing experience to educate, build, and sell software.

## Why

After nearly three years at VMware Tanzu Labs, I’m starting to look for new opportunities given the tumultuous times under the Broadcom acquisition / VMware Tanzu spin-off. I’m not just looking for another job, but rather a role where I can continue to mature in my career and skillset, learn and be mentored, and most importantly see measurable success from hard work.

**At the end of the day, I’m looking for a place where:**

- I can build/sell software with tangible customer impact
- I can grow my career with like-minded peers who take an empathetic and pedagogical approach to technology.
- I can take ownership and make meaningful contributions for a company poised for growth
