## Hi, friends

I decided to start writing a little blog to help document all the code related things I solve on a daily, mainly just as it
is way easier to organize my thoughts like this. Maybe it helps other people like it's going to help me.

I might make it easier to find things and I also might store other notes and thoughts on this as well, tbd.

Anyway, this is my first post ... yay ðŸŽ‰
