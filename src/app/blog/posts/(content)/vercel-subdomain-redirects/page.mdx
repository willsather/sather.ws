## Overview

While recently migrating from Cloudflare DNS to Vercel DNS _(obviously)_, I realized quickly I wasn't exactly sure how
to redirect my subdomains (like [`linkedin.sather.ws`](https://linkedin.sather.ws) to an external URL like
[`https://www.linkedin.com/in/willsather`](https://linkedin.sather.ws)) as I previously just relied on Cloudflare's
rules.

The reason I'm writing this today is that to achieve this exact behavior, I had to combine this
[GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/5622) discussion answer with three different Vercel community
guides ([one](https://vercel.com/guides/can-i-redirect-from-a-subdomain-to-a-subpath),
[two](https://vercel.com/guides/does-vercel-support-permanent-redirects), and
[three](https://vercel.com/guides/pointing-subdomains-to-external-services)).

In retrospect, this really isn't that difficult but it took long enough to test that I wish someone had just explained
it for me.

### Vercel Configuration

To define the redirects for Vercel, you can provide a `vercel.json` configuration file alongside your project
just like this:

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "host",
          "value": "linkedin.sather.ws"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/willsather"
    }
  ]
}
```

The documentation for this configuration file can be found [here](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration).

### 2. Add Subdomain URL to Project

Assuming this project is already pushed to Vercel, go to __Vercel Dashboard > _{`{Select your Project}`}_ > Settings >
Domains > Add Domain__, you can add a new

<Image alt="Vercel Add Subdomain" src="/assets/blog/images/vercel-subdomain-redirects/add-domain.png" />

and after confirmation:

<Image alt="Vercel Add Subdomain" src="/assets/blog/images/vercel-subdomain-redirects/subdomain-confirmation.png" />

<br />

### 3. Add `CNAME` Record to DNS

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard > Domains**.
2. Select your domain (in my case, `sather.ws`).
3. Create a new `CNAME` record with the `name` of your subdomain and `value` of `cname.vercel-dns.com` like this:

    <Image alt="Vercel DNS Records" src="/assets/blog/images/vercel-subdomain-redirects/dns.png" />


### 4. All Set!

Now, when someone visits [`https://linkedin.sather.ws`](https://linkedin.sather.ws), they will be redirected to my
LinkedIn profile, but this is applicable for any external url you would like!
