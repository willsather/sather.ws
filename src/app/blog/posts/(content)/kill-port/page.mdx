## Overview

Whenever something bad happens (generally Intellij crashing), I find myself trying to restart applications and often seeing this error:

<Error>
  <span className="font-mono text-sm mb-0">
    Failed to start server Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use
    :::3000 at Server.setupListenHandle [as _listen2] (node:net:1904:16) at
    listenInCluster (node:net:1961:12) at Server.listen (node:net:2063:7) at
    Server.listen (node:net:2063:7)
  </span>
</Error>


Then, I'd proceed to google `How to find and kill port`, which always led me to the many responses on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3855127/find-and-kill-process-locking-port-3000-on-mac)

### Solution

I added this to my `~/.zshrc` and never looked back.

```zshrc
killport() {
  for port in "$@"; do
    lsof -ti:$port | xargs kill -9
  done
}

alias kp="killport"
```

which means you can:

```zsh
killport 3000
killport 3000 8080
```

or for brevity :)

```zsh
kp 3000
kp 3000 8080
```
