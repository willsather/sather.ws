              <strong className="font-bold">a little about me:</strong> i
              graduated from university of minnesota with bachelors in computer
              science and am currently working as a software engineer at vmware
              tanzu labs. recently, been building and modernizing modern web
              apps / cloud apps with a bunch of cool software.
              <br /> <br />
              <strong className="font-bold">outside of work: </strong> i have
              always enjoyed working on various software projects (like this
              website, plus lots of things on my github to keep me busy). i also
              love to travel, cook, and cuddle with our two dogs. hopefully you
              enjoy meandering around my site, i&apos;m trying to keep it fun,
              so a bulk of this is just about what software i'm building, and
              given enough time, maybe writing about it.
              <br /> <br />
              anyways, welcome and feel free to say{" "}
